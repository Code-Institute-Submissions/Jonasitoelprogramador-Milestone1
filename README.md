#Journeyman Tapenade

  Journeyman Tapenade is a brand that specialises uniquely in high-quality tapenade (olive paste) for gross consumption.
The idea behind the creation of this brand and website is that tapenade is an incredibly tasty product, however, relatively 
few people know of it/eat it regularly.  A gap in the market methinks (a "tap gap" as I like to call it)!  Journeyman aims to 
bridge the tap gap both by increasing awareness of tapenade, and by producing a line of tapenade products.  

##UX

Given this context, 
the aim of this website is threefold:

1.  Educate the masses about tapenade - what it is and how it came about.
2.  Showcase and promote the upcoming line of tapenade related products.
3.  Explain how Journeyman the brand was conceived and provide people with the possibility of getting in touch.

This website targets food-enthusiasts, amateur/professional cooks and travel-oriented people.  People who are always on the look-out
for a new ingredient to spice up their cooking or who are adventurous when it comes to food and enjoy seeking out different flavours. 
The website helps this cross-section of people to do just this by informing users about tapenade (what it is, where it comes from, 
the different types) and to showcase and promote the upcoming line of tapenade products (as well as perhaps to suggest a few recipes 
involving tapenade!).
