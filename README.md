#Journeyman Tapenade

  Journeyman Tapenade is a brand that specialises uniquely in high-quality tapenade (olive paste) for gross consumption.
The idea behind the creation of this brand and website is that tapenade is an incredibly tasty product, however, relatively 
few people know of it/eat it regularly.  A gap in the market methinks (a "tap gap" as I like to call it)!  Journeyman aims to 
bridge the tap gap both by increasing awareness of tapenade, and by producing a line of tapenade products.  

##UX

Given this context, 
the aim of this website is threefold:

1.  Educate the masses about tapenade - what it is and how it came about.
2.  Showcase and promote the upcoming line of tapenade related products.
3.  Explain how Journeyman the brand was conceived and provide people with the possibility of getting in touch.

This website targets food-enthusiasts, amateur/professional cooks and travel-oriented people.  People who are always on the look-out
for a new ingredient to spice up their cooking or who are adventurous when it comes to food and enjoy seeking out different flavours. 
The website helps this cross-section of people by informing users about tapenade (what it is, where it comes from, 
the different types) and by showcasing and promoting the upcoming line of tapenade products (as well as perhaps to suggest a few recipes 
involving tapenade!).

An example of a user visiting the site for the first time could be someone who arrives on he landing page, reads the blurb about what tapenade is,
looks through the product list and send Journeyman a message asking when the products will be availiable. 

###Design

####Colour Scheme
There are three main colours: white, olive green and dark purple.  The latter two are the same as the colours of the hero image on the index page
thus producing an olive influenced colour harmony.

####Typography
The main font used in the site is "Noto Serif KR".  After experimenting with various fonts I found that this one had the right balance of 
being both classical and understated.  I added the backup font "serif" which will return the operating system's fallback serif font in case of the
primary font not loading.

####Imagery
The website makes use of lots of olive-related imagery as olives and olive trees/branches are more aesthetically appealing than pictures of tapenade.
That said, there are images of jars of tapenade on the product info page as it is important to give a visual representation of the product being promoted.

##Features
The site is compromised of 3 separate pages: "Home" page, "Product Info" page and "About Us" page.  All three pages are responsive (computer, ipad,
smartphone or anything in between!) and have a header that contains the navigation links for navigation within the site and a footer that contains
contact info as well as links to social media.
The index/home page contains a hero image and two responsive bootstrap rows.  The first of which explains what tapenade is and the second contains 
a quote.
The Product Info section is split into 9 bootstrap rows which are grouped into 3s, and each group relates to a Journeyman Tapenade product.  For 
example, the first group contains a row for the title of the product, a row for an image of the product and a row that contains text about the 
product.
