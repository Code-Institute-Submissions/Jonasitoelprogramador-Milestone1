#Journeyman Tapenade

Journeyman Tapenade is a brand that specialises uniquely in high-quality tapenade (olive paste) for gross consumption.
The idea behind the creation of this brand and website is that tapenade is an incredibly tasty product, however, relatively 
few people know of it/eat it regularly.  A gap in the market methinks (a "tap gap" as I like to call it)!  Journeyman aims to 
bridge the tap gap both by increasing awareness of tapenade, and by producing a line of tapenade products.  Given this context, 
the aim of this website is threefold:
1.  Educate the masses about the great taste of tapenade - what it is and how it came about.
2.  Showcase the brand-new line of tapenade related products.
3.  Explain how Journeyman the brand was conceived and provide people with the possibility of getting in touch.
